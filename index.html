                  <p> (6) An application to the appropriate tribunal under this section for authorisation to make an interim EDMO in respect of a dwelling may include an application for an order under paragraph 22 of Schedule 7 determining a lease or licence of the dwelling. </p>
                  <p> (7) In this section  “public sector body” means a body mentioned in any of paragraphs (a) to (f) of paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 14. </p>

                  <p> (2) The authority must take such steps as they consider appropriate for the purpose of securing that the dwelling is occupied. </p>
                  <p> (3) The authority must also take such other steps as they consider appropriate with a view to the proper management of the dwelling in accordance with the management scheme contained in the order (see paragraph 13 of Schedule 7). </p>
                  <p> (4) The authority must from time to time review— </p>
                  <p class='leaf'> a the operation of the order and in particular the management scheme contained in it, </p>
                  <p class='leaf'> b whether, if the dwelling is unoccupied, there are any steps which they could appropriately take under the order for the purpose of securing that the dwelling becomes occupied, and </p>

                  <p> (5) If on a review the authority consider that any variations should be made under paragraph 15 of Schedule 7, they must proceed to make those variations. </p>

                  <p> (3) If a third party requests them to do so at any time, the local housing authority must consider whether an amount by way of compensation should be paid to him in respect of any interference in consequence of a final EDMO with his rights. </p>

                  <p> (6) If no appeal is brought under section 143, an overcrowding notice is final and conclusive as to matters which could have been raised on such an appeal. </p>

<p> (1)The charge taking effect by virtue of [F1 section 11B ] (charge for repayment of discount) has priority immediately after any legal charge securing an amount—
</p><p>(a)left outstanding by the purchaser, or
</p><p>(b)advanced to him by an approved lending institution for the purpose of enabling him to acquire the interest disposed of on the first disposal,subject to the following provisions.
</p><p>(2)An advance which is made for a purpose other than that mentioned in subsection (1)(b) and which is secured by a legal charge having priority to the charge taking effect by virtue of [F1 section 11B ] , and any further advance which is so secured, shall rank in priority to that charge if, and only if, the registered social landlord by notice served on the institution concerned gives consent.The landlord shall give consent if the purpose of the advance or further advance is an approved purpose.
</p><p>(3)The registered social landlord may at any time by notice served on an approved lending institution postpone the charge taking effect by virtue of [F1 section 11B ] to an advance or further advance which—
</p><p>(a)is made to the purchaser by that institution, and
</p><p>(b)is secured by a legal charge not having priority to that charge;and the landlord shall serve such a notice if the purpose of the advance or further advance is an approved purpose.
</p><p>(4)The covenant required by [F1 section 11B ] does not, by virtue of its binding successors in title of the purchaser, bind a person exercising rights under a charge having priority over the charge taking effect by virtue of that section, or a person deriving title under him.A provision of the conveyance, grant or assignment, or of a collateral agreement, is void in so far as it purports to authorise a forfeiture, or to impose a penalty or disability, in the event of any such person failing to comply with that covenant.
</p><p>(5)In this section “approved lending institution” means—
</p><p>(a)a building society, bank, insurance company or friendly society,
</p><p>(b)[F2the Welsh Ministers], or
</p><p>[F3(c)an authorised mortgage lender (within the meaning of the Housing Act 1985 (see section 622 of that Act)).]
</p><p>(6)The following are “approved purposes” for the purposes of this section—
</p><p>(a)to enable the purchaser to defray, or to defray on his behalf, any of the following—
</p><p>(i)the cost of any works to the house,
</p><p>(ii)any service charge payable in respect of the house for works, whether or not to the house, and
</p><p>(iii)any service charge or other amount payable in respect of the house for insurance, whether or not of the house, and
</p><p>(b)to enable the purchaser to discharge, or to discharge on his behalf, any of the following—
</p><p>(i)so much as is still outstanding of any advance or further advance which ranks in priority to the charge taking effect by virtue of [F1 section 11B ] ,
</p><p>(ii)any arrears of interest on such an advance or further advance, and
</p><p>(iii)any costs and expenses incurred in enforcing payment of any such interest, or repayment (in whole or in part) of any such advance or further advance.In this subsection “service charge” has the meaning given by section 621A of the Housing Act 1985.
